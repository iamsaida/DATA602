## Assignment 3

### Introduction
For the study of Exploratory Data Analysis, I am using the life expectancy dataset which I have taken from kaggle. This dataset has 2938 rows and 22 columns. We run through this dataset and try to analyse the data. We will focus on population and gdp based on the life expectancy of the countries listed. We will try to figure our GDP growth with increase in population and period.
