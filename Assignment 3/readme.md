## Assignment 3

### Introduction
For the study of Exploratory Data Analysis, I am using the life expectancy dataset which I have taken from kaggle. This dataset has 2938 rows and 22 columns. We run through this dataset and try to analyse the data. We will focus on population and gdp based on the life expectancy of the countries listed. We will try to figure our GDP growth with increase in population and period.

### Operations performed to analyse data
Datatype of the dataset
List of all the unique countries in our dataset
Statistical analysis of numeric data
Showing the number of missing values in each column
Based on the missing values, dropping out the rows wich has missing values
Dropping out the unwanted columns
Renaming the columns
Mean
Boxplot
Finding out the correlation among all the columns
Plotting the graph showing correlation among all the columns
Histograms showing numerical values in each column
Scatter plot showing difference between different columns

### Conclusion
Here in this module, we have performed exploratory data analysis with health data set of different countries showing their population and gdp along with their life expectancy, adult mortality etc. We Observed the datatypes of the columns, found the missing values. Calculated the mean values of each column and plotted graphs between different columns of the dataset.We plotted the hiostogram to observe how the values are changing every year and also scatter plots to see how values are dependant on other columns. We also plotted the correlation graph which shows how values are varying depending on the other values.
